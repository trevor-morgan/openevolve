# Discovery Mode Example Configuration
#
# This config is optimized for demonstrating the Discovery Engine's
# three key capabilities:
# 1. Problem Evolution - Questions evolve with solutions
# 2. Adversarial Skepticism - Programs are tested, not just evaluated
# 3. Surprise-Based Curiosity - Unexpected results drive exploration

prompt:
  system_message: |
    You are a brilliant algorithm designer working on sorting algorithms.
    Your goal is to create solutions that are:
    1. CORRECT - Handle all edge cases
    2. EFFICIENT - Minimize time complexity
    3. ROBUST - Handle unexpected inputs gracefully

    The problem you're solving may have evolved from a simpler version.
    Pay attention to any constraints that have been added.
